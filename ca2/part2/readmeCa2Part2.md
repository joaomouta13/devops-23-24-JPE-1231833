### Part 2 - Build Tools with Gradle: Convert basic version of the Tutorial application to Gradle.

In this section of the assignment, we will be transitioning from Maven to Gradle for the basic version of the Tutorial application. This will involve creating a new branch in your repository named tut-basic-gradle, which will be used exclusively for this part of the assignment.

### Requirements

1. Create a new branch in your repository named tut-basic-gradle.
2. Start a new gradle spring boot project with the following dependencies: Rest Repositories, Thymeleaf, JPA and H2.
3. Extract the generated zip file into the folder "CA2/part2" of your repository. Then, check  the available gradle tasks.
4. Delete the src folder, and copy the src folder from the basic folder of the tutorial into the new folder.
   a. Copy the files webpack.config.js and package.json;
   b. Delete the folder src/main/resources/static/built/;
5. Add the gradle plugin org.siouan.frontend to the project.
6. Add "org.siouan.frontend-jdk17" version "8.0.0"
7. Configure the plugin in build.gradle.
8. Update the scripts section in package.json to configure the execution of webpack.
9. Add a task to gradle to copy the generated jar.
10. Add a task to gradle to delete all the files generated by webpack.

### Analysis

1. Create a new branch in your repository named tut-basic-gradle. This step is about version control using Git.
* It ensures that the changes made during the conversion process do not affect the main branch of the project.

2. Start a new gradle spring boot project with the following dependencies: Rest Repositories, Thymeleaf, JPA and H2. This step involves initializing a new Spring Boot project with Gradle as the build tool.
* The specified dependencies are for creating RESTful APIs, rendering server-side HTML views, persisting data using Java Persistence API (JPA), and using H2 as an in-memory database.
3. Extract the generated zip file into the folder "CA2/part2" of your repository. Then, check the available gradle tasks.
* This step involves extracting the project files from the generated zip file and checking the available Gradle tasks. This helps to understand the build lifecycle of the new Gradle project.
4. Delete the src folder, and copy the src folder from the basic folder of the tutorial into the new folder.
* This step involves replacing the source code of the new Gradle project with the source code from the basic version of the tutorial application.
5. Add the gradle plugin org.siouan.frontend to the project.
* This step involves adding a Gradle plugin that provides tasks to handle frontend resources in a Java project. This plugin can install Node.js and npm, and run npm and npx commands.
6. Add "org.siouan.frontend-jdk17" version "8.0.0"
* This step involves specifying the version of the frontend plugin to use. The version "8.0.0" is compatible with JDK 17.
7. Configure the plugin in build.gradle. This step involves configuring the frontend plugin in the build.gradle file.
* This could include specifying the Node.js version to use, the npm version, and the scripts to run.
8. Update the scripts section in package.json to configure the execution of webpack.
* This step involves configuring webpack, a static module bundler for JavaScript applications, in the package.json file.
9. Add a task to gradle to copy the generated jar.
* This step involves adding a Gradle task to copy the generated JAR file to a specified location. This can be useful for deployment or distribution purposes.
10. Add a task to gradle to delete all the files generated by webpack.
* This step involves adding a Gradle task to clean up the files generated by webpack. This can be useful to ensure a clean state before building the project.

### Design

The design of the conversion process from Maven to Gradle for the basic version of the Tutorial application can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Branch Creation: Create a new branch in the repository named tut-basic-gradle. This isolates the changes made during the conversion process from the main branch of the project.

2. Project Initialization: Initialize a new Spring Boot project with Gradle as the build tool. The project should include the following dependencies: Rest Repositories, Thymeleaf, JPA, and H2.

3. Project Setup: Extract the generated zip file into the folder "CA2/part2" of the repository. Check the available Gradle tasks to understand the build lifecycle of the new Gradle project.

4. Source Code Replacement: Delete the src folder of the new Gradle project and replace it with the src folder from the basic version of the tutorial application. Also, copy the webpack.config.js and package.json files and delete the src/main/resources/static/built/ folder.

5. Plugin Addition: Add the Gradle plugin org.siouan.frontend to the project. This plugin provides tasks to handle frontend resources in a Java project.

6. Plugin Version Specification: Specify the version of the frontend plugin to use. The version "8.0.0" is compatible with JDK 17.

7. Plugin Configuration: Configure the frontend plugin in the build.gradle file. This could include specifying the Node.js version to use, the npm version, and the scripts to run.

8. Webpack Configuration: Update the scripts section in package.json to configure the execution of webpack.

9. Task Addition: Add a task to Gradle to copy the generated JAR file to a specified location. This can be useful for deployment or distribution purposes.

10. Cleanup Task Addition: Add a task to Gradle to delete all the files generated by webpack. This can be useful to ensure a clean state before building the project.

### Implementation

Let's start by implementing the requirements for converting the basic version of the Tutorial application to Gradle. We will follow the steps outlined in the requirements and provide a detailed explanation for each step.

1. Create a new branch in your repository named tut-basic-gradle.

```bash
git branch tut-basic-gradle
git checkout tut-basic-gradle
```

2. Start a new Gradle Spring Boot project with the specified dependencies. Use https://start.spring.io/ to generate the project with the following dependencies:
* Rest Repositories
* Thymeleaf
* JPA
* H2

3. Extract the generated zip file into the folder "CA2/part2" of your repository. Then, check the available Gradle tasks.

4. Check the available gradle tasks:

```bash
./gradlew tasks
```

5. Delete the src folder.

```bash
cd CA2/part2
rm -r src
```

6. Copy the src folder from the basic folder of the tutorial into the new folder.

```bash
cp -r path/to/basic/src CA2/part2
```

7. Copy the webpack.config.js

```bash
cp ../../ca1/basic/webpack.config.js CA2/part2
```

8. Copy the package.json

```bash
cp ../../ca1/basic/package.json CA2/part2
```

9. Delete the folder src/main/resources/static/built/

```bash
rm -r src/main/resources/static/built
```

10. Before running the application you have to do the following changes:

* In the class Employee.java change the following imports, where is used javax. change to:

```java
import java.util.Objects;

import jakarta.persistence.Entity;
import jakarta.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import jakarta.persistence.Id;
```

* In the build.gradle file, add the following plugin dependencies:

```gradle
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'org.springframework.boot' version '3.2.4'
    id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version '1.1.4'
    id "org.siouan.frontend-jdk17" version "8.0.0"
    id 'com.github.node-gradle.node' version '3.1.1'
}
```

* Add the following configuration in the package.json file, before the scripts:

```json
  "packageManager": "npm@9.6.7",
```

Now run the application:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

* Commit and push the changes.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Extracted tut and react file into ca2/part2 closes #17"
git push origin tut-basic-gradle
``` 

11. In order to configure the plugin in build.gradle, add the following configuration:

```gradle
frontend {
	nodeVersion = "16.20.2"
	assembleScript = "run build"
	cleanScript = "run clean"
	checkScript = "run check"
}
```

12. Update the scripts section in package.json to configure the execution of webpack.

```json
 "scripts": {
    "webpack": "webpack",
    "build": "npm run webpack",
    "check": "echo Checking frontend",
    "clean": "echo Cleaning frontend",
    "lint": "echo Linting frontend",
    "test": "echo Testing frontend"
  }
```

* Commit and push the changes.

```bash
git add package.json
git commit -m "update the script in package.json closes #18"
git push origin tut-basic-gradle
```

13. Now you can build the project, and the run the application using the following commands:

```bash
./gradlew build
./gradlew bootRun
```

Here is the frontend of the application:

![Gradle Application Run](./gradleApp.png)

14. Add a task to Gradle to copy the generated jar into a folder named "dist" located at the project root folder level.

```gradle 

task copyJar(type: Copy) {
	dependsOn build

	from 'build/libs'
	into 'dist'

	include '**/*.jar'
}
```
* Commit and push the changes.

```bash
git add build.gradle dist
git commit -m "added a new task to copyJar closes #19"
git push origin tut-basic-gradle 
```

15. Add a task to Gradle to delete all the files generated by webpack.

```gradle
task cleanWebpack(type: Delete) {
	delete 'src/main/resources/static/built'
}

clean.dependsOn cleanWebpack
```
* Commit and push the changes.
```bash 
git add build.gradle
git commit -m "added new task to clean all the files generated by the webpack closes #20"
git push origin tut-basic-gradle
```

16. Close the branch and merge to the main branch.

```bash 
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff tut-basic-gradle 
```

17. Mark the repository with the tag ca2-part2.

```bash
git tag ca2-part2
git push origin ca2-part2
```

### Conclusion

In this report, we effectively migrated the Tutorial application from Maven to Gradle, following a structured process. We created a new branch, initialized a Spring Boot project with Gradle, and replaced Maven-specific configurations with Gradle equivalents. By adding necessary plugins and tasks, we ensured smooth execution and management of the project.

    <property name="logback.classic.jar" value="${lib.dir}/logback-classic-${logback.version}.jar" />

    <!-- Compile source code -->
    <target name="compile">
        <mkdir dir="${build.dir}/classes" />
        <javac srcdir="${src.dir}" destdir="${build.dir}/classes" includeantruntime="false">
            <classpath>
                <fileset dir="${lib.dir}">
                    <include name="**/*.jar" />
                </fileset>
                <pathelement location="${slf4j.api.jar}" />
                <pathelement location="${logback.classic.jar}" />
            </classpath>
        </javac>
    </target>

    <!-- Copy frontend assets -->
    <target name="copy-resources">
        <copy todir="${build.dir}/classes">
            <fileset dir="${webapp.dir}" />
        </copy>
    </target>

    <!-- Package the application -->
    <target name="build" depends="compile">
        <mkdir dir="${dist.dir}" />
        <jar destfile="${dist.dir}/myapp.jar" basedir="${build.dir}/classes" />
    </target>
  </project>
```

3. Delete the src folder.

```bash
cd CA2/part2Alternative
rm -r src
```

4. Copy the src folder from the basic folder of the tutorial into the new folder.

```bash
cp -r path/to/basic/src CA2/part2
```

5. Copy the webpack.config.js.

```bash
cp ../../ca1/basic/webpack.config.js CA2/part2
```

6. Copy the package.json.

```bash
cp ../../ca1/basic/package.json CA2/part2
```

7. Delete the folder src/main/resources/static/built/.

```bash
rm -r src/main/resources/static/built
```

8. Set up Ant tasks for building and running the project.

```bash
ant build
``` 

* commit and push the changes.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "new: created build file for Ant tool closes #21"
git push origin tut-basic-ant
```

9. Add the frontend building part.

```xml
<target name="start-webpack-server" description="Start webpack development server">
  <exec executable="cmd" dir="${basedir}" failonerror="true">
    <arg value="/c" />
    <arg value="npx" />
    <arg value="webpack-dev-server" />
    <arg value="--config" />
    <arg value="webpack.config.js" />
  </exec>
</target>

<target name="start" description="Start the application" depends="build, start-webpack-server">
    <java jar="${dist.dir}/myapp.jar" fork="true" spawn="true"/>
    <echo message="Application started."/> 
</target>

        <!-- Clean -->
<target name="clean">
    <delete dir="${build.dir}" />
    <delete dir="${dist.dir}" />
</target>

        <!-- Default target -->
<target name="default" depends="clean, build" />
```

10. Now, you have to edit the package.json file to add the following scripts:

```json
{
  "name": "spring-data-rest-and-reactjs",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Demo of ReactJS + Spring Data REST",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",

    "webpack": "^5.91.0",
    "webpack-cli": "^5.1.4",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^5.0.4"
  }
}
```

11. Edit the webpack.config.js file to add the following configuration:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/main/js/app.js',
  devtool: 'source-map',
  cache: true,
  mode: 'production', // Or 'production' for optimized builds
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, './src/main/resources/static/built'),
    filename: 'bundle.js',
  },
  devServer: {
    hot: true, // Enable hot module replacement
    open: true, // Automatically open the browser
    historyApiFallback: true,

  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
        exclude: /(node_modules)/,
        use: [{
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            presets: ['@babel/preset-env', '@babel/preset-react']
          }
        }]
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/, // Add a rule for CSS (optional)
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader']
      }
    ]
  }

};
```

12. Create the .babelrc file with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
}
```

13. Run the application using the following command:

```bash
ant start
```

* Commit and push the changes.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "webpack-dev-server is running successfully closes #22"
git push origin tut-basic-ant
``` 

14. Add a task to Ant to copy the generated JAR.

```xml
<!-- Copy the generated JAR to dist folder -->
<target name="copy-to-dist" depends="build">
  <copy file="${dist.dir}/myapp.jar" todir="${basedir}/${dist.dir}" />
</target>
```

* Run the task using the following command:

```bash
ant copy-to-dist
```

* Commit and push the changes.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "added a task to copy the generated JAR closes #25"
git push origin tut-basic-ant
```

15. Add a task to Ant to delete all the files generated by webpack

```xml
  <!-- Delete webpack generated files -->
<target name="clean-webpack" description="Delete webpack generated files">
  <delete>
    <fileset dir="src/main/resources/static/built"/>
  </delete>
</target>

<target name="clean" depends="clean-webpack">
<delete dir="${build.dir}" />
<delete dir="${dist.dir}" />
</target>
```

* Run the task using the following command:

```bash
ant clean-webpack
```

* Commit and push the changes.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "added a task to clean webpack generated files closes #26"
git push origin tut-basic-ant
```

16. Close the branch and merge to the main branch.

```bash
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff tut-basic-ant
```

17. Mark the repository with the tag 'ca2-part2'.

```bash
git tag ca2-part2
git push origin ca2-part2
```

### Implementation
Before merging the repository with the main branch, I have tried to implement the frontend. It consisted with a variety of alterations in several packages.

1. Build.xml:

```xml
<project name="TutorialApplication" default="build">

    <!-- Define properties -->
    <property name="src.dir" value="src/main/java" />
    <property name="build.dir" value="build" />
    <property name="dist.dir" value="dist" />
    <property name="lib.dir" value="lib" />
    <property name="webapp.dir" value="src/main/webapp" />
    <property name="slf4j.version" value="2.0.12" />
    <property name="slf4j.api.jar" value="${lib.dir}/slf4j-api-${slf4j.version}.jar" />
    <property name="logback.version" value="1.2.6" />
    <property name="logback.classic.jar" value="${lib.dir}/logback-classic-${logback.version}.jar" />


    <!-- Compile source code -->

            </manifest>
        </jar>
    </target>

    <!-- Copy the generated JAR to dist folder -->
    <target name="copy-to-dist" depends="build">
        <copy file="${dist.dir}/myapp.jar" todir="${basedir}/${dist.dir}" />

2. Created the .babelrc file:

```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"],
  "plugins": ["@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties"]
}
```

3. Created babel.config.js

```javascript
module.exports = {
    presets: ['@babel/preset-env', '@babel/preset-react'],
    plugins: ['@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties']
};
```

4. Altered my package.json:

```json
{
  "name": "spring-data-rest-and-reactjs",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Demo of ReactJS + Spring Data REST",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",

    "data",
    "react"

    "webpack": "^5.91.0",
    "webpack-cli": "^5.1.4",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^5.0.4"
  }
}
```
5. Altered the webpack.config.js

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    entry: './src/main/js/app.js',
    devtool: 'source-map',
    cache: true,
    mode: 'production', // Or 'production' for optimized builds
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, './src/main/resources/static/built'),
        filename: 'bundle.js',
    },
    devServer: {
        hot: true, // Enable hot module replacement
        open: true, // Automatically open the browser
        historyApiFallback: true,

    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.js$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                use: {
                    loader: 'babel-loader',
                    options: {
                        presets: ['@babel/preset-env']
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }


};
```
6. Added the following jar files:
* h2-2.2.224-jar
* logback-classic-1.5.5.jar
* logback-core-1.5.5.jar
* spring-boot-loader-tools-2.7.18.jar

### Conclusion

In this report, I successfully migrated the Tutorial application from Maven to Ant, following a structured process. I started by creating a new branch and configuring Ant for the project. Next, I replaced Maven-specific configurations with Ant equivalents and set up Ant tasks for building, packaging, and running the application. Additionally, I added tasks to copy the generated JAR and clean up webpack-generated files.

The Gradle build tool is more advanced and provides better support for Java projects. Despite my efforts, I couldn't get the Employees information to be displayed on the frontend. Furthermore, I found that Ant-built projects require more manual configuration compared to Gradle.
